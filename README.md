# System Programming finding prime numbers using threads
This project was made in university in order to learn more about windows programming and threads.
The app finds the largest and smallest prime numbers from a folder with 1000 files which contain a large amount of integers.
During this project i learned how processes and threads work, how to use the "Producer-Consumer" design pattern, how certain windows api's work, how mutexes work etc.
